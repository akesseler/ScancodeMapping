## Project Build

Best way to build the whole project is to use _Visual Studio 2019 Community_. Thereafter, 
download the complete sources, open the solution file `ScancodeMapping.sln`, 
switch to release and rebuild all.

Keep in mind, Visual Studio has to be started with administrator privileges to get the 
program running in debug mode.
