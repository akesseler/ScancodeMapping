## Scancode Mapping

The _Plexdata Scancode Mapping_ is a tool allowing to switch and/or to disable keyboard 
keys. But note, the physical keyboard key is never changed. The only change made by this 
program is the change of the Windows scan-code of keyboard keys. These changes are put 
into Windows registry.
